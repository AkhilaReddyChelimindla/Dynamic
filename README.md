Dynamic Tabs Application

Description: The Dynamic Tabs application is a web-based tool that allows users to manage multiple tabs dynamically. Users can create new tabs, load different URLs within each tab using iframes, close tabs, and navigate between tabs seamlessly. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The design pattern used here is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

Features:

--> Tab Management: Users can create new tabs dynamically by clicking the "+" button. Each tab contains an input field to enter a URL and a button to load the URL into an iframe.
--> URL Loading: Users can enter a URL in the input field of each tab and load the corresponding web page into the iframe by clicking the "Load" button or pressing Enter. 
--> Tab Navigation: Users can switch between tabs by clicking on the tab titles. Keyboard shortcuts are also provided for navigating between tabs using Ctrl + Left Arrow and Ctrl + Right Arrow keys.
--> Tab Closing: Users can close tabs by clicking the close button (x) next to each tab title. Closing a tab removes it from the interface.

Requirements: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
